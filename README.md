# Overview
This repository contains implementations of APIs for popular Large Language Models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA, and others. It also supports image generation and manipulation APIs for some of these models.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitthecodelabs/LLMs_apis.git
cd LLMs_apis
```

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You may need additional packages for specific APIs. Install them as required, e.g.:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up API keys: Ensure you have the necessary API keys for the services you're working with. Refer to the individual scripts for the required key names and environment variables.

# Usage
Run the scripts from the command line or integrate them into your project. Here's an example of running a script:

```
python chatgpt_api.py
```

Update environment variables for API keys or configuration as needed:

```
export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

# Scripts Overview
Hereâ€™s a brief description of each script:

- chatgpt_api.py: Interface for OpenAI's ChatGPT API, providing text-based generation and conversation capabilities.

- chatgpt_image_api.py: Connects to OpenAI's image generation API, allowing you to create images from text prompts.

- claude_api.py: Integration with Claude's API for text-based interactions and analysis.
