Meaning can be found in everyday acts of kindness, connection, and purpose.\\n* **It's okay to question and explore:**  The search for meaning is a lifelong journey. It's healthy to question, explore different perspectives, and refine your own understanding of what gives your life meaning.\\n* **Don't be afraid to define meaning for yourself:**  Ultimately, the meaning of *your* life is something you get to define.
